I'm a research engineer at [Lily MedTech Inc.](https://www.lilymedtech.com/company/), a medical AI startup based in Tokyo. I'm working on research and development of computer vision techniques for a novel ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) device.

I obtained a PhD in computer science majoring artificial intelligence from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2021.

<!-- Additionally, I work as a research assistant for <a href="https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/project/1111094/1111094_07.html">"CREST Deep"</a> project, funded by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Motivation of this project is to compress Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) without compromising the accuracy. -->

In 2018 summer, I did a research internship at <a href="https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/">Preferred Networks Inc</a>. I was involved in designing deep generative models for generating molecular graphs. This work resulted in [GraphNVP](https://preferredresearch.jp/2019/07/16/graphnvp), the first normalizing-flow based model for generating attributed graphs.
